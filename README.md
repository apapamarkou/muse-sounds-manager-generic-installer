# Muse Sounds Manager Installer

This project provides a simple Bash script to download, extract, and install the Muse Sounds Manager from its `.deb` package. The script automates the process of setting up the necessary directories and copying files to their appropriate locations on your system.

## Why create an alternative installer?

While MuseScore provides excellent sound libraries, it doesn't offer a universal installer. This can be a challenge for users of independent distributions like Arch, Slackware, Solus, and others that donâ€™t use the official supported package managers. This alternative installer simplifies the process, making it easy to set up the MuseScore Sound Manager on a wider range of systems.

## Features

- **Automated Download**: Downloads the latest Muse Sounds Manager `.deb` package directly from the official source.
- **Easy Installation**: Extracts and installs the package contents (`opt` and `usr` directories) to your system with a single command.
- **Cleanup**: Removes temporary files after installation, keeping your system tidy.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following:

- A Linux-based operating system.
- `wget` installed for downloading the `.deb` package.
- `ar` and `tar` commands available for extracting the `.deb` package.

## Install Option 1 : "The Quick and easy"

Copy the following command, paste it in a terminal and hit [ENTER]. Thats it!

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apapamarkou/muse-sounds-manager-generic-installer/main/install_muse_sounds_manager.sh | bash
```

These commands will download and execute the script, installing the Muse Sounds Manager on your system.

## Install Option 2: "The long way"

If you prefer to clone the repository and run the script manually, follow these steps:

1. **Clone this repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/muse-sounds-manager-installer.git
    cd muse-sounds-manager-installer
    ```

2. **Make the script executable**:

    ```bash
    chmod +x install_muse_sounds_manager.sh
    ```

3. **Run the script**:

    ```bash
    ./install_muse_sounds_manager.sh
    ```

    This will download, extract, and install the Muse Sounds Manager to your system.

## OpenSuSE only: fix "doesn't work"

This installer and official `rpm` download wont work without installing `ca-certificates`. To make it work run the following command:

```
sudo zypper install ca-certificates*
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can find the Muse Sounds Manager in your application menus or launchers
